# Digtool
Digtool is a virtualization-Based Framework for Detecting Kernel Vulnerabilities. It was first published by IceSword Lab of 360 on the USENIX.
You can access the [paper](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity17/technical-sessions/presentation/pan) here.

My work is reproduct the Digtool without any source code.
